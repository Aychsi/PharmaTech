Developed a comprehensive equity research framework analyzing 20 companies across pharmaceutical and technology sectors. The project implements multiple valuation methodologies including Comparable Company Analysis (Comps), Residual Income Model (RIM), and scenario-based valuations. Utilized CAPM and Fama-French three-factor models to calculate expected returns, alpha, beta, and Sharpe ratios. Created profitability and capital efficiency metrics including ROE, ROA, ROIC, and EBITDA margins. Built a portfolio stress testing dashboard that evaluates portfolio performance under various scenarios including interest rate shocks and earnings surprises. The analysis generated price targets, identified investment opportunities, and exported comprehensive reports to Excel for further analysis. This project demonstrates proficiency in financial modeling, statistical analysis, and portfolio risk management.
